# CaveExplorer
This is the final assignment in my Essential Computing class at Roskilde University. It is a "mini-project" as our professor called it. This is the first real programming class I have taken at Roskilde University.

## What is it?
It is a game you can play in the terminal of your IDE. The goal is to collect as many points as possible, without moving into any traps, and then exiting the cave.

## How is it made?
Language: Java

The code consists of mulitpe different methods each controling a specific part of the game. After having handed in the assignment I realise that the player movement and gameboard each should have been different classes, which would have made the code more compact and easier to understand.
